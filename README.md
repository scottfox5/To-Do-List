# To-Do List

This is a full-stack To-Do list application using a jQuery front-end, node back-end, and SQL database. Users can add a task, and when complete, the user can use a checkbox to mark a task complete. After marking a task complete, the task will change appearance and be sorted to the bottom of the list. Users are also able to update and delete the tasks/details.
