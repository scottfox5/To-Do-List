#Weekend Challenge 4

This is a To Do list application using the full stack with the list being stored as an sql database. When the user adds a task, the database is updated. When the task is complete the user can check it off and its status will change in the database to complete (true). Also, completed items have a different appearance on the screen and they are moved to the bottom of the list. Finally, when the user wants to delete the item from the list, a delete button can be clicked, which will ask the user to confirm, and upon confirmation it will also be removed from the database.
